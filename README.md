This project includes foundational code for managing user inputs, including a simple function to register new users and a unit test suite to ensure functionality.
As of now...two braches and what I have listed below.......
Features
1.User Input Functionality

The new_user() function captures first name and last name with length validation. This is designed to ensure that the names are not only valid strings but also conform to length restrictions for database optimization and UX design. Email and Password Validation

Advanced email validation checks for format correctness and length to prevent common input errors and potential security issues. Password creation is rigorously validated to meet security standards including minimum length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters), which helps in safeguarding user accounts against common attack vectors like brute force. Comprehensive Account Creation Process

The create_account() method orchestrates the sequence of input validations and provides feedback on the success or failure of account creation, enhancing user experience and system reliability.

Project Structure
Unit Testing
In this project, I leverage Python's unittest framework along with unittest.mock to conduct comprehensive testing of the user authentication components. The mock module helps simulate user interactions, such as inputting names and passwords, to validate the correctness of both input fields and the underlying logic without the need for a live input system.

Objectives
The primary objectives of our testing strategy include:

Ensuring robust user input validation.
Verifying the security measures in password handling.
Confirming the integrity of the complete user registration process.
Example Test Cases
Here are some example test cases demonstrating our approach:

Name Validation: Tests ensure that empty names are rejected and valid names are accepted.
Password Validation: Various scenarios test for password strength, including checks for length, character variety, and match confirmation.
Running the Tests
